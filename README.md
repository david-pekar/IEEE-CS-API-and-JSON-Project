# IEEE-CS-API-and-JSON-Project
This was the project completed in our second organization meeting. We learned how to use apis and json to represent the data in a readable form. 
The API we used in this case was a weather api that gets current weather from a given city. 
In the project we chose Austin and tried to see if it was cloudy at the given time. 
At first it was challenging to see the data we were seeing. 
Then using json we made the data readable.
